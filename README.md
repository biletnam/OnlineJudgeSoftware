# OnlineJudgeSoftware
This software contains some other advanced features as well than my previous OnlineJudge Software.
online judge software to handle programming contests and practice area as well 
it contains Two Logins:
-> for users 
-> for hosts
For users-> 
tutorials for new algorithms so that user can first learn about new algorithms.  
coding arena where user can code problems in 4 different languages C, C++, Java, Python (most frequently used!!), more 
languages will be added soon.
can also give programming contests 
Concepts involved: multithreading, socket programming, database management, networking, Java oops, etc.
For hosts->
Can make his own contest for others to participate.
(Can only make the contest if server accepts the request!!)
I have designed the software in such a way that the server works on one PC and CLIENT on the other.
Software is still until work and i will be soon adding leaderboard as well.
I am trying my best to make this software launch in my college for coding rounds at intra college level.
Any Suggestions are welcome!!
Thank You!!
